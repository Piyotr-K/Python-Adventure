Notes for stuff learned:

Mostly for code from tests and the learning process
code that was commented out

Tkinter:

- Getting pack to fit the entire screen
# self.topFrame.pack(expand=tk.YES, side=tk.TOP, fill=tk.BOTH, anchor=tk.N)
# self.topFrame.pack_propagate(False)

# self.botFrame.pack(expand=tk.YES, side=tk.BOTTOM, fill=tk.BOTH, anchor=tk.S)
# self.botFrame.pack_propagate(False)

- Disabling pack_propagate so the small items inside don't affect the
    size of the frame

- Lambda expressions for buttons
for x in range(4):
    self.btns.append(
        tk.Button(master = self.botFrame,
        text=f"Btn{x}",
        command = lambda x=x: ad.Adventure.btn_press(x)
        ))
- when used in for loop need the x=x: in order for the
    lambda expression to keep the value at that time
    not the ending value of x

- Grid row and col configuration
# self.window.grid_rowconfigure(0, weight=1)
# self.window.grid_columnconfigure(0, weight=1)
# self.window.grid_rowconfigure(1, weight=1)

- Object Oriented Analysis and Design class I really should've
    payed more attention in class, I should use a Model-View-Controler
    Pattern because I just ran into the problem of what happens
    if you don't, you basically pull your hair out in frustration
